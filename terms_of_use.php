                4. Subscription Plans & Fees
                <br>
                <br>
                A Free Member may upgrade to a pro membership plan, which shall be billed by WebSoft365 on a recurring
                subscription basis (“Pro Member Subscription Plan”). Under the Pro Member Subscription Plan, a Pro
                Member shall be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). Billing cycles
                are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on Pro Member’s preference when purchasing a Pro
                Member Subscription Plan. At the end of each Billing Cycle, the Pro Member Subscription Plan is
                automatically renewed under the exact same conditions unless (i) the Pro Member cancels the Pro Member
                Subscription Plan under the relevant tab of its Member Account, or (ii) WebSoft365 elects to not renew
                the Pro Member Subscription Plan, prior to the commencement of the next renewal period. You may also
                terminate your Pro Member Subscription Plan at any time via your Member Account.
                <br>
                All payments for the Pro Member Subscription Plan shall be processed using a third-party payment
                processor, namely, Paddle.com (“Paddle”). Paddle shall collect the Pro Member Subscription Plan fees, on
                our behalf, as well as provide customer services. Paddle accepts the following payment methods: credit
                card, debit card, Paypal and Apple Pay.
                <br>
                WebSoft365 may, at its sole discretion and at any time, modify the Pro Member Subscription Plan fee. Any
                change in the Pro Member Subscription Plan fee shall become effective at the end of the then-current
                Billing Cycle. We shall provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in the Pro Member
                Subscription Plan fee and/or Sticky Topic Advertisement Subscription Plan fee so as to give you the
                opportunity to terminate the Pro Member Subscription Planbefore such change becomes effective. Your
                continued use of the Services, after any change/modification in the Pro Member Subscription Plan and
                Sticky Topic Advertisement Subscription Plan, comes into effect, shall constitute your agreement to pay
                the modified Pro Member Subscription Plan fee amount.
                <br>
                You acknowledge and agree to pay WebSoft365 the Pro Member Subscription Plan fee on time. Payments made
                by you to WebSoft365 for the Pro Member Subscription Plan shall be non-refundable.
                <br>
                WebSoft365 does not guarantee that the Pro Member Subscription Plan will be offered indefinitely on its
                Website. WebSoft365 reserves the right to change the features and the fees for the Pro Member
                Subscription Plan.
